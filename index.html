                     <p>I am a middle school math teacher at the Math and Science Success Academy. I have been teaching for the last five years, which has honed my skills in time management, problem-solving, creativity, flexibility, and interpersonal skills. If I can successfully teach a class of more than 50 students in a portable classroom in the parking lot of a school or outside on the recess benches in the middle of a construction zone, I can tackle any project, problem or task throw my way.</p>

                    <p> In addition to my duties as a math teacher, I coach the Science Olympiad team, the Robotics team, mentor three new teachers, and run the math department. These additional duties have helped shape my ability to both lead a team and to work collaboratively within a team.</p>
