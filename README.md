# redueportfolio
1. Created three html links
2. Using the format given to the class by Collin Nelson, I deconstructed the code in order to work backwards. 
3. Using my backwards designing method, I was able to recreate the desired product.
4. I was able to correctly link all three html pages to my css stylesheet. 
    a. a background image (full-bloom) was added. 
    b. the margins were resized. 
    c. a container was added. 
    d. The majority of the stylesheet was taken from Collin Nelson. I struggled a lot with creating my own. 
5. I was able to add a footer 
6. In the About Me section
    a. A photo of me has been added that is not linked to a website. The text was wrapped around the image using the code from uvm.edu/~bnelson/computer/css/wrappingtextaroundimages.html
    b. I added additional personal information to fill in more space. 
7. In the Portfolio section, 
    a. All the images are now linked correctly. 
    b. All the photos are now named. 
8. In the contact section, 
    a. It was reformated through the css style sheet since it is now correctly linked.
